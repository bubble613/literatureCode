2DReCA Segmentation and Hybrid Features on Histopathology Images for Cancer Detection

2DReCA (2D Reny entropy with Cultural Algorithm) segmentation on the histopathological images are performed and hybrid features are extracted to detect cancer.
1. main_code_Cultural_Renyi() - performs 2DReCA segmenation on the pathological images.
2. Morp_feat() -  computed the morphological features from the segmented images.
3. feature_extraction() - this function exatracts glcm and belbp features from the grayscale images.
