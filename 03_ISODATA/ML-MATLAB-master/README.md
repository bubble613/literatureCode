Machine Learning with MATLAB:

This Repository contanis my solutions to Statistical Pattern Recognition course (2013-2014).

It contains:
1 - Linear regression, overfitting and reqularization
2 - Bayesian classification of Iris data, k-fold validation
3 - Probability density estimation
4 - Fisher’s Discriminant and Least square classification
5 - ‫‪Support‬‬ ‫‪vector‬‬ ‫‪Support Vector Machine (SVM), One versue One, One versue all
6 - Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sequence Modeling.
